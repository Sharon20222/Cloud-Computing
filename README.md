# Cloud Computing Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Cloud Computing MapReduce Project! This repository contains the implementation of a MapReduce algorithm designed to process large datasets using distributed computing. The project leverages cloud infrastructure to efficiently handle data-intensive tasks, making it suitable for big data analysis and processing.

## Setup

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Hadoop
- Cloud provider account (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cloud-computing-mapreduce.git
    cd cloud-computing-mapreduce
    ```

2. **Install required Python packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Set up your cloud environment:**
   
   Ensure you have your cloud provider's CLI installed and configured. For AWS, you can follow the [AWS CLI setup guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).

4. **Configure Hadoop:**

   Follow the Hadoop installation guide for your operating system and ensure it is properly configured to run in pseudo-distributed or fully-distributed mode.

## Usage

### Running the MapReduce Job

1. **Upload your data to HDFS:**

    ```bash
    hdfs dfs -put /local/path/to/your/data /hdfs/path/to/your/data
    ```

2. **Run the MapReduce job:**

    ```bash
    hadoop jar /path/to/hadoop-streaming.jar \
        -input /hdfs/path/to/your/data \
        -output /hdfs/path/to/output \
        -mapper /path/to/mapper.py \
        -reducer /path/to/reducer.py
    ```

3. **Retrieve the results:**

    ```bash
    hdfs dfs -get /hdfs/path/to/output /local/path/to/output
    ```

## Examples

### Word Count Example

The `examples/` directory contains a simple word count example to demonstrate how the MapReduce process works. To run the example:

1. **Navigate to the examples directory:**

    ```bash
    cd examples/wordcount
    ```

2. **Upload the example data to HDFS:**

    ```bash
    hdfs dfs -put input.txt /wordcount/input
    ```

3. **Run the word count job:**

    ```bash
    hadoop jar /path/to/hadoop-streaming.jar \
        -input /wordcount/input \
        -output /wordcount/output \
        -mapper mapper.py \
        -reducer reducer.py
    ```

4. **Retrieve and view the results:**

    ```bash
    hdfs dfs -get /wordcount/output/part-00000 .
    cat part-00000
    ```
