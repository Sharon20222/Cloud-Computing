# MapReduce Pi Calculation Project

## Overview

This project implements a MapReduce program to estimate the value of Pi using the Monte Carlo method. The Monte Carlo method is a statistical technique that uses random sampling to estimate numerical results. In this case, we simulate dart throws at a square board enclosing a unit circle to approximate the value of Pi.

## Setup

### Environment Setup

To run this project, you need to set up a development environment with the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed
- Apache Hadoop installed and configured
- Eclipse IDE (or any Java IDE of your choice) for development

### Download Programs and Related Documentation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/sharon20222/Cloud-Computing.git
   ```

2. Ensure that you have Apache Hadoop installed and configured on your system. Refer to the [official Hadoop documentation](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/) for installation instructions.

3. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse).

4. Compile the Java source files (`GenerateRandomNumbers.java` and `PiCalculation.java`) to generate the executable JAR files.

## Execution

### Step 1: Generate Input Files

1. Run the `GenerateRandomNumbers.java` program to create input files containing random (x, y) pairs within a specified radius. Save these files in the `input/` directory.

### Step 2: Run MapReduce Job

1. Compile `PiCalculation.java` and package it into a JAR file.

2. Execute the MapReduce job using Apache Hadoop. Run the following command in the terminal:
   ```
   hadoop jar PiCalculation.jar PiCalculation input/ output/
   ```

3. Monitor the progress of the MapReduce job in the terminal. Once completed, you'll find the output files in the `output/` directory.

### Step 3: View Results

1. Open the output files generated by the MapReduce job to view the estimated value of Pi.
