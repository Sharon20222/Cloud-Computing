# PageRank Project

This project explores the implementation of the PageRank algorithm using PySpark and Scala on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

**[PageRank Project Google Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lVJnKeSYl98x4ETqf3FyxHxGSTM7PTMVbqBESrdnaDg/edit?usp=sharing)**

## Introduction

PageRank is an algorithm initially developed to rank web pages based on their link structure. It works by assessing both the number and quality of links pointing to a page to estimate its significance.

- **Concept**:
  PageRank uses link analysis to infer the relative importance of web pages. Pages with more inbound links from significant sites are considered more crucial.

- **Illustration**:
  An example illustrating how PageRank values are distributed among connected pages.

## Design

- **Manual Solution**:
  Designed a basic version of the PageRank algorithm to understand core principles.

- **PySpark and Scala Implementation**:
  Implemented the algorithm using PySpark for Python-based processing and Scala for type-safe, high-performance computing.

- **Comparison**:
  Compared results from both implementations to validate accuracy and efficiency.

## Implementation

### Manual Solution

Implemented a simple version of the PageRank algorithm manually to comprehend its operational mechanism.

- **Problem Description**:
  A description of the problem setup for manual computation of PageRank.

- **Steps**:
  Step-by-step process of calculating PageRank manually.

### PySpark

- **Setup**:
  Configured PySpark on GCP, utilizing its distributed computing capabilities.

- **Code**:
  Developed and executed the PageRank algorithm using PySpark.

### Scala

- **Setup**:
  Set up Scala environment on GCP and integrated it with Spark.

- **Code**:
  Implemented PageRank in Scala, leveraging its efficiency for processing large datasets.

## Testing

Detailed steps to test the PageRank implementations.

### PySpark

1. **Create Directories in HDFS**:

    ```bash
    $ hdfs dfs -mkdir hdfs:///data
    $ hdfs dfs -mkdir hdfs:///data/mllib
    ```

2. **Upload Data to HDFS**:

    ```bash
    $ hdfs dfs -put ./data/mllib/* hdfs:///data/mllib
    ```

3. **Execute PySpark Program**:

    ```bash
    $ spark-submit PageRankProject/pagerank.py hdfs:///data/mllib/pagerank_data.txt 2
    ```

4. **Review Output**:
    Review the console output and results from the execution.

### Scala

#### Method 1: Using Predefined Example

1. **Upload Data to HDFS**:

    ```bash
    $ hdfs dfs -put links.txt .
    ```

2. **Execute Scala Program**:

    ```bash
    $ run-example SparkPageRank links.txt 2
    ```

3. **Review Output**:
    Check the console output and results from the Scala program.

#### Method 2: Interactive Testing in Spark Shell

1. **Upload Data to HDFS**:

    ```bash
    $ hdfs dfs -mkdir hdfs:///pagerank
    $ hdfs dfs -put links.txt hdfs:///pagerank
    ```

2. **Run Code in Spark Shell**:

    Execute code line-by-line in the interactive shell.

3. **Review Output**:
    Observe the output from the Spark shell execution.

## Enhancements
